ARCore Depth API Codelab
========================
Copyright 2020 Google LLC.  All rights reserved.

This Codelab provides examples for how developers can use the Depth API in ARCore to expand the realism of their AR applications.

This codelab provides step-by-step instructions for how to use depth for the following use-cases:
 * Depth-based occlusion: Allowing virtual objects to hide behind real-world objects.
 * Visual effects: Showing the 3D geometry of the scene with pulsing colors.

## Android Studio projects

This codelab contains the following projects:
 * `part0_work`: The starter app.  You should make edits to this module when doing this codelab.
 * `part1`:  Reference code of what your edits should look like when you complete Part 1 (checking depth support).
 * `part2`:  Reference code when you complete Part 2 (retrieving the depth texture).
 * `part3`:  Reference code when you complete Part 3 (visualizing the depth texture).
 * `part4_completed`:  The final version of the app (including depth-based occlusion).  Reference code when you complete Part 4 and this codelab.
